# PRD — Mirror MVP

## Problem
People want quick, confident answers to “What should I wear?”, “How do I do this makeup look?”, or “What hairstyle fits my face?” without doom‑scrolling.

## Audience
Busy adults (and teens with parent approval) who want actionable tips fast.

## Goals (MVP)
1) **Style Chat** – text + optional selfies/outfit photos.
2) **Outfit Picker** – build looks from a simple “closet.”
3) **Makeup Coach** – step‑by‑step routine with timers.
4) **Hair Helper** – suggestions by face shape & hair goals.
5) **Lookbook** – save/share looks.

- Respect privacy; images stored with user control.

## Success
- TTI < 2s for static screens; first AI answer < 8s.
- First‑week retention > 25%.
- ≥10 saved looks/user in week 1.
